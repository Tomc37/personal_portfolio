          <p>
            Former Associate Operations Manager at Ubisoft turned programmer,
            Tom left Ubisoft to fulfill his dream of working in software
            development. Working through a retraining course provided by IT
            Career Switch , Tom came to master the programming and coding
            languages of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Python and more.

            <strong>Number Guesser</strong><br /><br />One of the first projects
            completed as part of the course. This is a simple guessing game
            against a computer player with random numbers generated as the
            target number and for the computer's guess. Whoever is closest to
            the target number gains a point, the player getting the point in
            case of a tie. The html elements were all provided but the script
            file had to be completed from ground up to get the game working. You
            can find the game

            <strong>Mysterious Organism</strong><br /><br />This was one of the
            first major JavaScript projects undertaken. The idea was to build an
            object factory in JavaScript that creates 15 random DNA pairs of a
            mysterious organism. Pairing the key as the organisms specimen
            number along with the value of DNA pairs. After that, additional
            functions were added as methods to use certain criteria to judge the
            organisms survival and force mutations on individual DNA bases. The
            file itself is just a .js script file and would need to be ran in
            terminal or console. You can find the github repository
            <a

            <strong>Web Development</strong><br /><br />This portfolio website
            itself represents the most recent example of Web Development, the
            previous progress can be tracked at other websites.

            expanded upon that, using flexbox but now with responsive elements
            using media queries to adjust to smaller browser sizes.<br />Finally,
            this portfolio website is the third Web Development project and some
            simple JavaScript is now involved which was used to display this
            text you are reading right now.

            <strong>Find Your Hat Game</strong><br /><br />
            After building out more skills in JavaScript, I moved on to then
            make an interactive game. Using an array to create a 2D map, we have
            our character moving around this map using simple commands in order
            to find their "hat". This is the game's winning condition but the
            game can be lost if the character falls down a hole or attempts to
            move out of bounds of the map. You can find the gitub repository
            <a href="https://github.com/Tomc37/find_your_hat" target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >
            but please note that the game requires some familiarity with Node JS
            to be ran.

            <strong>Jammming</strong><br /><br />
            Following the Find Hat project, I then moved on to develop skills in
            the areas of asynchronous JavaScript, HTTP requests and the React
            framework. This resulted in the Jammming web-app that you can find
            <a href="https://jammmingtc.surge.sh/" target="_blank">here</a
            >.<br />
            This web-app communicates with the Spotify API, requiring login to a
            Spotify account as an alternate method of creating playlists on your
            spotify account. You simply search for songs and add them to a
            playlist and save that playlist.<br />
            All of the components are built using React class components with
            several states being passed to props with data being received from
            and transmitted through the Spotify API.
